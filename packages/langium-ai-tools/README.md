# Langium AI Tools

## Overview

This project provides core tools that make it easier to build AI applications for Langium DSLs. These core tools help to solve the following problems around building AI applications by making it easier to:

- Determine which models work well for your DSL
- Evaluate which changes to your tooling actually improve your generation results
- How to process DSL documents in a way that makes sense for your DSL & target application

To solve these problems this package provides:

- Splitting Support: Using your DSL's parser to make it easier to pre-process documents before ingest (such as into a vector DB)
- Training & Evaluation Support: Assess the output of your model + RAG + whatever else you have in your stack with regards to a structured input/output evaluation phase.
- Constraint Support: Synthesize BNF-style grammars from your Langium grammar, which can be used to control the token output from an LLM to conform to your DSL's expected structure (this feature has been added directly into the **langium-cli** itself, as it has wider general applications).

What's also important is what is not provided:
- *We don't choose your model for you.* We believe this is your choice, and we don't want to presume we know best or lock you in. All we assume is that you have a model (or stack) that we can use. For tooling that leverages models directly, we'll be providing a separate package under Langium AI that will be separate from the core here.
- *We don't choose your stack for you.* There are many excellent choices for hosting providers, databases, caches, and other supporting services (local & remote). There's so many, and they change so often, that we decided it was best to not assume what works here, and rather support preparing information for whatever stack you choose.

LLMs (and transformers in general), are evolving quite rapidly. With this approach, these tools help you build your own specific approach, whilst letting you keep up with the latest and greatest in model developments.

## Installation

You can install Langium AI Tools by running:

```sh
npm i --save langium-ai-tools
```

## Usage

### Splitting

Langium AI Tools presents various splitting utilities that are simple but flexible. This includes:
- retrieving all nodes of a specific type from a document
- splitting a document into chunks by node type (with or without comments)
- generating program maps

For example, if you have a DSL that looks like this:

```dsl
// A dsl that allows writing functions...
function foo() { ... }
function bar() { ... }
```

Assuming your Langium parser rule for these functions is called `Func`, you could write a splitter like so to chunk by functions:

```ts
const chunks: string[] = splitByNode(
    dslProgramString,
    [
        (node) => node.$type === 'Func'
    ],
    myLanguageServices.grammar,
    // default options, comment rule names can be set to [] to avoid including comments in chunks
    // { commentRuleNames: ['ML_COMMENT', 'SL_COMMENT'] }
);
```

And you would get back something like this:
```json
[
    'function foo() { ... }',
    'function bar() { ... }'
]
```

In case you want just the AST node, and don't want it transformed to text, you can use the `splitByNodeToAst` function instead, giving you back the raw AST nodes to do with as you want.

If you want a program map (like in the case of generating a mapping of your repo), you can utilize the `ProgramMapper` class.

```ts
import { ProgramMapper } from 'langium-ai-tools/splitter';

const myProg = `
function foo() { ... }
function bar() { ... }
`;

const services = createMyDSLServices(EmptyFileSystem).mydsl; // will differ based on the name of your DSL
const mapper = new ProgramMapper(services, {
    mappingRules: [
        {
            predicate: (node) => node.$type === 'Func',
            map: (node) => `func ${node.name}`
        },
        ...
    ]
});
const programMap: string[] = mapper.map(myProg);
```

Which would give you an output like so:

```json
[
    'func foo',
    'func bar'
]
```

In both cases, you can provide predicates for the nodes that are of interest to you. The splitter chunking is a bit more opinionated, but the program mapper allows fine-grained generation when needed.

For examples you can check out the [example-dsl-evaluator](../examples/example-dsl-evaluator/README.md) project, which also contains splitting & mapping examples.

### Evaluation

Regardless of how you've sourced your model, you'll need a metric for determining the quality of your output.

For Langium DSLs, we provide an series of *evaluator* utilities to help in assessing the correctness of DSL output.

It's important to point out that evaluations are *not* tests, instead this is more similar to [OpenAI's evals framework](https://github.com/openai/evals). The idea is that we're grading or scoring outputs with regards to an expected output from a known input. This is a simple but effective approach to determining if your model is generally doing what you expect it to in a structured way, and *not* doing something else as well.

Take the following evaluator for example. Let's assume you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally, and the [ollama-js](https://github.com/ollama/ollama-js) package installed. From a given base model you can define evaluatiosn like so.

```ts
import { Evaluator, EvaluatorScore } from 'langium-ai-tools/evaluator';
import ollama from 'ollama';

// get your language's services
const services = createMyDSLServices(EmptyFileSystem).MyDSL;

// define an evaluator using your language's services
// this effectively uses your existing parser & validations to 'grade' the response
const evaluator = new LangiumEvaluator(services);

// make some prompt
const response = await ollama.chat({
    'llama3.2',
    [{
        role: 'user',
        content: 'Write me a hello world program written in MyDSL.'
    }]
});

const es: EvaluatorScore = evaluator.evaluate(response.message.content);

// print out your score!
console.log(es);
```

You can also define custom evaluators that are more tuned to the needs of your DSL. This could be handling diagnostics in a very specific fashion, extracting code out of the response itself to check, using an evaluation model to grade the response, or using a combination of techniques to get a more accurate score for your model's output.

In general we stick to focusing on what Langium can do to help with evaluation, but leave the opportunity open for you to extend, supplement, or modify evaluation logic as you see fit.

## Contributing

If you want to help feel free to open an issue or a PR. As a general note we're open to accept changes that focus on improving how we can support AI application development for Langium DSLs. But we don't want to provide explicit bindings to actual services/providers at this time, such as LLamaIndex, Ollama, LangChain, or others. Similarly this package doesn't provide direct bindings for AI providers such as OpenAI and Anthropic here. Instead these changes will go into a separate package under Langium AI that is intended for this purpose.
