# Langium AI

## Overview

Langium AI is a suite of tools that makes it easier to build AI applications for Langium DSLs, by providing helpful tools to leverage your existing Langium DSL services, and to integrate LLMs tightly with your Langium DSL. In doing so, existing or new Langium DSLs can benefit from first-class LLM support just as well as other common programming languages.

You can read more about Langium AI here as well, [Langium AI: The fusion of DSLs and LLMs](https://typefox.io/blog/langium-ai-the-fusion-of-dsls-and-llms/).

In particular, Langium AI helps to solve the following problems:

- Selecting good models with regards to your DSL
- Evaluating DSL output from an LLM
- Processing DSL programs as data, while respecting the structure of your DSL
- Developing good natural language interfaces for DSLs

This is achieved by using a two pronged approach.

- [Core tools](/packages/langium-ai-tools/README.md): which leverage Langium's service set to help you build, evaluate, and trust your AI applications.
- _Coming soon_: AI-based tools which leverage LLMs directly in tandem with your DSL.

For more information you can refer to the [langium-ai-tools](/packages/langium-ai-tools/README.md) package, which leverages much of your DSL's existing Langium services to make it easier to evaluate your application, as well as to process DSL documents.
